ATTENTION: This project is stale, I would recommend that you check out my tile_engine2 repo for a better more fully complete tile engineLightweight Tile Engine For HTML5 Game Creation=============This a a working version from what I learned from <a href="http://www.johnegraham2.com/web-technology/javascript-2d-tile-engine-canvas-helper-objects/">Johne Graham</a>Additions include* dynamic viewport* gridded tile sets* kinetic mouse scrolling* timestep and minimal physics* plus more....Please try this out in Chrome before any other browser. I believe it is becauseChrome uses V8, but chrome will get around 233fps where all other browsers get only around 90fps.Status------This project is stale, I would recommend that you check out my grouter repo for a better more fully complete tile engineLicense-------	Lightweight Tile Engine For HTML5 Game Creation	Copyright (C) 2010  John Graham	Copyright (C) 2011  Tim Anema	This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify	it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by	the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or	(at your option) any later version.	This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,	but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of	MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
